# You do not have to configure the other data backends. If unsure, choose
# 'datastore' as it does not require any additional configuration.

# Replace user, pass, host, and database with the respective values of your
# Cloud SQL instance.

# Google Cloud Storage and upload settings.
# Typically, you'll name your bucket the same as your project. To create a
# bucket:
#
#   $ gsutil mb gs://<your-bucket-name>
#
# You also need to make sure that the default ACL is set to public-read,
# otherwise users will not be able to see their upload images:
#
#   $ gsutil defacl set public-read gs://<your-bucket-name>
#
# You can adjust the max content length and allow extensions settings to allow
# larger or more varied file types if desired.

# OAuth2 configuration.
# This can be generated from the Google Developers Console at
# https://console.developers.google.com/project/_/apiui/credential.
# Note that you will need to add all URLs that your application uses as
# authorized redirect URIs. For example, typically you would add the following:
#
#  * http://localhost:8080/oauth2callback
#  * https://<your-app-id>.appspot.com/oauth2callback.
#
# If you receive a invalid redirect URI error review you settings to ensure
# that the current URI is allowed.
